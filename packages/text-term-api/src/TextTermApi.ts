/**
 * Handler for processing the application mode escape code.
 *
 * Application mode is a feature specific to Extraterm. It is a generic
 * escape code intend for sending large amounts of data from an application
 * running on the remote end of the pty to the terminal emulator application.
 *
 * The structure of the escape code is:
 *
 *   ESC "&" [parameters separated by semicolon] 0x07 [data] 0x00
 *
 * In english, the escape character followed by ampersand then multiple
 * parameters separated by semicolons, then the 0x07 character (BEL),
 * raw data then terminated by a NUL byte.
 *
 * Once the 0x07 (BEL) character is received then the `start()` method is
 * called with the parameters. Then the `data()` method is called multiple
 * times as chunks of data are received, finally `end()` is called once the
 * NUL byte is seen.
 *
 * The `start()` and `data()` methods respond with an
 * `ApplicationModeResponse` object. This is usually just
 * `{action: ApplicationModeResponseAction.CONTINUE}` but in the even that
 * the `ApplicationModeHandler` detects an error or that the remote program
 * has crashed, then `{action: ApplicationModeResponseAction.ABORT}` can be
 * returned. This will immediately exit application mode in the emulator
 * return to normal processing. It is also possible to 'push back' the unused
 * part of the data buffer in this case by using the `remainingData` field in
 * the `ApplicationModeResponse` object.
 *
 * `ApplicationModeResponseAction.PAUSE`
 * can be used to pause processing of the PTY output stream by the emulator.
 * See `pauseProcessing()` and `resumeProcessing()` in the `EmulatorAPI`.
